  Description: The longest up sequence takes two user inputted numbers (one 
  to fill array 1, and the other fill array 2) and uses a third array 
  (reference array) to sort and find the upsequence of the data.  To achieve
  the longest up sequence the program will look through the given array and 
  pull out the numbers in sequential order, skipping the numbers who are not
  included in the up sequence and then starting a new up sequence with those
  skipped numbers.  The program then uses the longest up sequence in 
  reference to the (reference array) to display the relation to second 
  original array.  See end of program for examples.
