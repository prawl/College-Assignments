a)

b) 
//In this algorithm, index represents the starting exponent, 0, and as long as
//index is less than or equal to the greatest exponent it will keep incrementing.
//To find the greatest exponent you have to use the p.degree().
//Within the loop, it uses p.getCoefficient to find the coefficient of the 
//current exponent and multiplies it by 5, and uses p.changeCoefficient to 
//change the coefficient to the new number.

//In this problem you have to change each variable to its derivative
//Index represents the starting exponent, 0, and as long as index is less than 
//or equal to the greatest exponent, it will keep incrementing.
//To find the greatest exponenet you have to use the p.degree().
//Within the loop it uses. p.changeCoefficient to change the coefficient and the
//exponent. It uses p.getCoefficient to find the coefficient of the current 
//exponent then multiplies it by the current degree, then decreases the current
//degree by one, then moves on to the next exponent.
